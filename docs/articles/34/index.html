But what happens when girlfriends become <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=technoweenie">technoweenies</a>? I love her, but why on earth does she have to double click on links? And why oh why does she type &quot;hotmail.com&quot; into Google rather than just typing it into the address bar!?</p><p>Why? Because she a technoweenie.</p><p>I guess the question is - Would I want it any other way? OK, so she does take 10 times as long to search the internet, but could I cope with a fellow geek? I guess the truth is I kinda like being the &#39;computer-savvy&#39; one in our relationship. So she has a job working with real people. So what? I love my mac, and it&#39;s all good... Really... Am I on my own here? Or does everyone else who&#39;s in the &#39;web business&#39; have a &#39;significant other&#39; whose as power-geek as them?</p><p>Oh well, she&#39;ll learn. No matter how much she hates my iPhone, she&#39;ll still use it to watch the iPlayer.</p></article></main><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/33">200 Miles Due South</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/35">She said Yes!</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
