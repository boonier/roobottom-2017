<h1>Jon&#39;s School Days</h1>
<p>I had such an awesome day yesterday as Josie very kindly let me shadow her teach. Yeah, I was a bit nervous but also dead excited to be out of the office and having fun with a bunch of kids all day. </p>
<p>Some of you will know that it&#39;s crossed my mind to go do teacher training in September, so wanted to see what it was all about before I signed up to anything. It&#39;s weird seeing one of your friends tech a bunch of 8 and 9 year old, to me it doesn&#39;t seem all that long ago that I was their age. I was really impressed with the way she controlled the class, and the obvious affection the kids had for her. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve got to say, teachers work damn hard. They work their collective asses off. Which is a bit of a sticking point for me. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m adverse to a bit of hard work (ahem) but quite a lot of the paperwork seems so unnecessary. I can&#39;t imagine anyone becoming a teacher unless they had a passion for working with kids, and the government seems to be squashing this by putting undue pressure on hard working school staff. I&#39;m not really ruling out teaching as a possibility, but I&#39;ve spoken to entirely too many people in the profession that are bitter about the workload. </p>
<p>I dunno, we&#39;ll see. It&#39;d be good to check out a few more schools (and years) first I think. The best bit of the day for me was thirty-five manic kids singing me the bumblebee song. Awesome!</p>
