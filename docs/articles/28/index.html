As you may imagine, I was chuffed to bits to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roobottom/1798830018/">meet little Amelie</a> - she&#39;s gorgeous and despite myself I think I actually said &quot;Awwww&quot;.

I mean, come on, what self-respecting parent wouldn&#39;t want Baby smokes-a-lot around to teach their kid at an early age that smoking is not only sociably acceptable, but also makes you look cool. I&#39;m surprised this little guy hasn&#39;t got a pair of gnarly shades or far out tattered jeans - Just look how cool he looks puffing away on that big tab.</p><p>Well done proud parents - I bet you can&#39;t wait to see what I get her for Christmas!</p></article></main><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/27">Lake Garda, Italy</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/29">Glubble Family Edition</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
