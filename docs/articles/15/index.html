Wolverhampton Civic Hall? 9th March 2006? 7 O&#39;clock? Yes, we&#39;ll have a bit of that.</p><p>Although I&#39;ve only even seen one episode of the <a href="http://www.themightyboosh.com/">tv series</a> I had already realised the genius of the Boosh. One time is enough you see, one time only to drink in the sweet sweet nipple-nectar from the Boosh&#39;s comedy teat.</p><p>In review I can only say brilliant brilliant brilliant! It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me spit my beer over the guy in front. Sorry.</p><p>I&#39;d recommend that you all go, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s all sold out. (I guess some simple checking would have confirmed this, but I really can&#39;t be bothered). Anyway, you can always look at some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/mightyboosh/">fine photos</a> of the event.</p></article></main><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/14">My Black Dog</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/16">Jon&#39;s School Days</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
