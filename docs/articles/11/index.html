Walsall admittedly could be accurately described as a shit hole, having been done down by such literacy geniuses as <a href="http://www.chavtowns.co.uk/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=816" title="Walsall on chavtowns.co.uk">chav towns</a> and even <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=97428" title="What&#39;s Walsall Like?">Google</a>. But I would like to offer a different point of view.</p><p>Walsall isn&#39;t what he buildings look like, or the amount of money spent on some new statue in the middle of town - It&#39;s the people. I&#39;m sure this is true of anywhere you live... In the words of <a href="http://www.walsallcommunitychurch.org" title="Walsall Community Church">Vic</a></p><blockquote><p>People Are Important</p></blockquote><p>So I&#39;d like to stand against all the crap spoken about Walsall, and say if we are to improve our town we should be proud of it! It&#39;s a diverse miss-mash of people who for the most part are brilliant. Yeah, we have our problems and our rough areas, but where doesn&#39;t? Thank God for Walsall, and the people in it. We really could be great!</p></article></main><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/10">An Arresting Situation</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/12">A Quick Post About Tea</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
