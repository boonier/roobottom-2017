<h1>The Little Chef breakfast in review</h1>
<p>The place? Little Chef, Oxford Peartree Services, A34, England. </p>
<p>The breakfast? A sausage, a rasher of bacon, a hash brown, baked beans and scrambled &quot;eggs&quot;. </p>

<p>In an attempt to bring you wholly interesting and original content, here is a review of a breakfast I ate while visiting the very fine and historical town of Oxford. Traditionally the Little Chef was something that filled my heart with dread, the childhood memories of long car journeys and sweaty pancakes are still all to clear in my mind. </p>
<p>It was with a sense of trepidation that I boldly ordered a &quot;early starter&quot; (it was 12 noon) breakfast. To be fair it was mainly yum, and the hash brown (an old Roobottom family favourite) went down a treat.</p>
<p>It was only when I came to consume what I could only presume to be scrambled eggs that things started to look down. As you may be able to see from the photograph, the eggs were very skilfully avoided while the rest of the breakfast was polished off with aplomb. So, there you have it, another exciting incite to the wonderful world of Roobottom.</p>
