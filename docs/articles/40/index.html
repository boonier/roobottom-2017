<h1>Sigur Ros at the Eden Project</h1>
<p>Katie and I are just back from a weekend in Cornwall with a few mates where we surfed, drank some <a href="http://www.tributeale.co.uk/">great beer</a> and enjoyed the amazing Sigur Ros live at the Eden Project.</p>
<p>Sigur Ros were one of those bands that had somehow passed me by so when our friend Tim suggested that we book tickets to see them I went more for the promise of surf than interest in the music. </p>

<p>We&#39;d been to the <a href="http://www.edenproject.com/">Eden Project</a> a few years before and I was really exited to go back. It&#39;s a brilliant place, especially the rainforest biome which had really grown since our previous visit.</p>
<p>As a venue it really succeeds. It&#39;s a beautiful setting and the unique atmosphere really adds to the music. It&#39;s also really well run with helpful stewards a token system for drinks that means there&#39;s never a queue at the bar. Someone really know what they&#39;re doing.</p>
<p>We arrived late, just in time to grab a beer and some food and catch the start of <a href="http://www.ohdaughter.com/">Daughter</a> who were great. They&#39;re really melodic and boy she can sing, well worth a watch if you get the chance.</p>
<p>Eden is built at the bottom of an old quarry; the walls of which now team with plant life. By the time Sigur Ros took to the stage it was dusk and strings of fairly lights twinkled in the tress. </p>
<p>On stage, smoke filled the space as the band and their 11-piece orchestra started their set. The full-width monitor displayed a bizarre array of images as we were treated to what I can only describe as a wall-of-sound the band had built in front of the stage. </p>

<p>It was perfect. The venue and the atmosphere just worked so well. The light show too was spectacular. Lasers and smoke galore. I don&#39;t mean to gush, but it really was one of the best gigs I&#39;d ever been too. I was absolutely blown away by the band, his voice, the weird instruments and that sound. Oh, that brilliant sound.</p>
