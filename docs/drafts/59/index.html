Champaign corks were popped and pizza was enjoyed by the whole team before we, very quickly, very diligently, returned to work.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/59/big-red-button.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Robin, Viv and I gather around the beautifully designed button to activate Firefly 6 in our offices in Hammersmith, 12th December 2016" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-134-1-big-red-button.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-134-1-big-red-button.jpg">Robin, Viv and I gather around the beautifully designed button to activate Firefly 6 in our offices in Hammersmith, 12th December 2016</span></figcaption></figure><p>It seems like a good point to pause, an reflect on the past 18 months and the changes in our team and working practices that enabled us to release the biggest step-change in our product to date.</p><h2 id="spring-summer-2015">Spring / summer 2015</h2><p>It seems almost impossible to me now that we started thinking about Firefly 6 a whole 18 months ago. We’ve packed an awful lot into that year and a half, working hard to release the best Firefly to date.</p><h3 id="user-research-begins">User research begins</h3><p>We knew roughly what teachers, students and parents wanted from the next version of Firefly, but there was still lots of work to do to refine our ideas into a definite, focused list of features that would work for everyone across web and native apps.</p><p>As Head of Product, Viv ran a large number of discovery workshops with teachers, students and parents from a large number of our schools. Armed with this research, our UX team was able to start sketching solutions from which we could create low-fi, interactive, product mock-ups. These were then tested with more users, refined, and tested again.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/59/me-user-testing.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Me doing some user testing at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, November 2016" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-90-1-me-user-testing.jpg"> <img src="/images/articles/59/sketching.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="An early sketch from a sketching workshop we ran at  the Firefly offices" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-72-2-sketching.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionPreface">From first to last: </span><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-90-1-me-user-testing.jpg">Me doing some user testing at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, November 2016</span> <span class="m_figure__captionPunctuation">and </span><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-72-2-sketching.jpg">An early sketch from a sketching workshop we ran at the Firefly offices</span></figcaption></figure><p>This discovery phase isn’t just limited to the start of a project, rather we conduct user research at every stage. We’re lucky that our clients don’t mind being guinea pigs as we refine Firefly throughout the whole development process. We also engaged an agency to connect with non-client teachers, students and parents, ensuring that new features work for everyone.</p><h3 id="we-built-our-first-pattern-library">We built our first pattern library</h3><p>It was also at this time where we started to think about the way we built Firefly for the web. Until Firefly 6, we would produce a design, and the Front-End team would produce the HTML, CSS and Javascript necessary for that feature. There was little re-use of code, meaning if we found a bug with one feature, changes were that we’d have to fix it multiple times, on several different pages.</p><p>What we needed was a pattern library! In October we were joined for a few days by Anna Debenham who literally wrote the book on <a href="http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/">front-end style guides</a> to help us catalogue Firefly’s user interface.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/59/anna-and-danielle.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Anna and Danielle discuss the relative merits of button patterns in the old Firefly office, October 2015" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-104-1-anna-and-danielle.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-104-1-anna-and-danielle.jpg">Anna and Danielle discuss the relative merits of button patterns in the old Firefly office, October 2015</span></figcaption></figure><p>Together with the designs for the new features we used the catalogue to build a “single source of truth” library of interface elements. This means that Firefly is now essentially built from a kit of parts. If we need a button, we can just call one in from the library. Even better, if we find a bug in one button, we can fix it once in the pattern libby, and it fixes it everywhere.</p><h2 id="autumn-winter-2015">Autumn / Winter 2015</h2><p>While research and design were progressing nicely, thoughts turned to a busy conference season. With the Firefly Learning Conference just around the corner and Bett looming, we knew we needed something more tangible than interactive mock-ups to show people.</p><h3 id="bett">Bett</h3><p>We now had enough of an idea <em>what</em> to build, we just had to build it, and all before the Bett show in January.</p><p>It would be the first time clients and prospects alike could get hands-on with the new Firefly. In a sterling effort by all involved, we cut a demo-ready version of Firefly less than 24 hours before the start of the show, and had our most successful Bett show to date.</p><h2 id="spring-summer-2016">Spring / Summer 2016</h2><p>At the Firefly Learning Conference in January we’d confidently told our clients that they could expect Firefly 6 in the summer term. By the spring it was apparent that we couldn’t meet this deadline and release a version of Firefly that was of sufficient quality. So we took the difficult decision to delay the release to the next logical point where schools would have a chance to install it in-between terms: Christmas.</p><h3 id="new-navigation">New navigation</h3><p>In the summer we we’re able to release the new navigation, and because it was now in the hands of schools quickly iterate it based on feedback from a large group of users. As with all changes, it was met with a mixed reception, but the vast majority of users loved the changes we’d made.</p><h2 id="autumn-winter-2016">Autumn / Winter 2016</h2><p>We were now nearing the end of our development phase. A significant portion of both the web app and native iOS and Android apps had now been completed, and we were on target for our completion date of 28th November, which would give us 2 weeks to do final testing before launch on 12th December.</p><h3 id="epics-squads-and-guilds">Epics, Squads and Guilds</h3><p>It wouldn’t have been possible to build such complex software with a relatively small team without some smart ways of working.</p><p>We use an Agile-like methodology to manage the specific tasks we ask our team to complete. With a fixed time scale, we are constantly massaging the <em>scope</em> of our product’s features.</p><p>We spilt sets of features up into logic chunks. These we call Epics. An Epic is a set of features that makes sense end-to-end. For example, the new task setting flow was a single Epic. This included all the backend logic, and user interface elements for teachers, parents and students.</p><p>Each Epic is worked on by a team called a Squad. A Squad is a self contained unit of UX’ers, Designers, Developers and a manager. Everyone who’s needed to research, design, build, refine and manage workflow for that one Epic.</p><p>There are parts of the product that may be relevant to more than one Squad. For example, the Pattern Library is used by all squads working on the Firefly web interface. To manage changes and updates to these areas we have Guilds. Typically a Guild will contain a representative from each Squad, and meet on an ad-hoc basis when changes are needed.</p><h3 id="the-final-push">The final push</h3><p>Building software is hard; Building great software is very hard. So it was understandable that the final few weeks before our production deadline was filled with late nights and take-outs in the office.</p><p>It is a testament to the hard work of everyone involved that we brought this incredible new version in on time. Not just the team who built the software, but also the teams who support Firefly, those that ensure that clients are happy and, heck, even the guys that flog it in the first place. They’re all responsible in equal part for Firefly 6.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/59/team-firefly.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Almost all of Team Firefly at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, 15th November 2016" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-95-1-team-firefly.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-95-1-team-firefly.jpg">Almost all of Team Firefly at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, 15th November 2016</span></figcaption></figure><p>We’ve certainly learned a thing or two along the way, not least that we need more development resource, but having just landing the biggest series A investment in Education Technology in the UK, we’re certainly now in a position to do that.</p></article></main></div></body></html>
