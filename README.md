# Jon Roobottom’s personal website

This is the source code for my personal website. It’s a static-html website that’s generated by [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Most of what my `gulpfile` does is string together third-party plugins, but it does use some custom plugins that I built specifically (see `/modules_backend`).

I drew heavily on the ideas of Sean Farrell’s [source code](https://github.com/rioki/www.rioki.org) for his own personal site.

## API

The API currently only consists of two commands:

* `gulp`: to build the site, watch for changes, and set-up a local test server.
* `gulp images`: to process all the images used by the site into web-ready files.
