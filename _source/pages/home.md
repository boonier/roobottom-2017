Welcome to my website. My name is Jon Roobottom, and I make web-based tools that are a joy to use.

Iâ€™m currently the Head of Design for Firefly Learning, where I lead a small team of incredibly talented people.

This is my personal site where I mainly post pictures of my family and friends in the gallery, or short diary-like stories in notes. I also write the odd article on subjects like web-design, running and education technology.
